INSTRUCTIONS

Create a SQL database using the attached CSV files.
Use the database to answer the following questions.
All answers that return money values should be rounded to 2 decimal points and preceded by the "$" symbol (e.g. "$1432.10").
All answers that return percent values should be between -100.00 to 100.00, rounded to 2 decimal points and followed by the "%" symbol (e.g. "58.30%").
Copy & paste the questions from the section below into a new plain .txt file named: {firstname}_{lastname}_code_challenge.txt (e.g. "john_smith_code_challenge.txt").
Provide all of the results of your work as answers; we cannot evaluate your work without your query results!
Provide all code, including what you used to create the database and import data, and answers related to each question immediately below the question.
Feel free to leave lots of notes/comments to help us understand your work.
When you are ready, reply to this email and attach your results.

Code Challenge v2.11

1. Data Integrity Checking & Cleanup

Alphabetically list all of the country codes in the continent_map table that appear more than once. Display any values where country_code is null as country_code = "FOO" and make this row appear first in the list, even though it should alphabetically sort to the middle. Provide the results of this query as your answer.

For all countries that have multiple rows in the continent_map table, delete all multiple records leaving only the 1 record per country. The record that you keep should be the first one when sorted by the continent_code alphabetically ascending. Provide the query/ies and explanation of step(s) that you follow to delete these records.

2. List the countries ranked 10-12 in each continent by the percent of year-over-year growth descending from 2011 to 2012.

The percent of growth should be calculated as: ((2012 gdp - 2011 gdp) / 2011 gdp)

The list should include the columns:

rank
continent_name
country_code
country_name
growth_percent

3. For the year 2012, create a 3 column, 1 row report showing the percent share of gdp_per_capita for the following regions:

(i) Asia, (ii) Europe, (iii) the Rest of the World. Your result should look something like

Asia	Europe	Rest of World
25.0%	25.0%	50.0%


4a. What is the count of countries and sum of their related gdp_per_capita values for the year 2007 where the string 'an' (case insensitive) appears anywhere in the country name?

4b. Repeat question 4a, but this time make the query case sensitive.

5. Find the sum of gpd_per_capita by year and the count of countries for each year that have non-null gdp_per_capita where (i) the year is before 2012 and (ii) the country has a null gdp_per_capita in 2012. Your result should have the columns:

year
country_count
total

6. All in a single query, execute all of the steps below and provide the results as your final answer:

a. create a single list of all per_capita records for year 2009 that includes columns:

continent_name
country_code
country_name
gdp_per_capita
b. order this list by:

continent_name ascending
characters 2 through 4 (inclusive) of the country_name descending
c. create a running total of gdp_per_capita by continent_name

d. return only the first record from the ordered list for which each continent's running total of gdp_per_capita meets or exceeds $70,000.00 with the following columns:

continent_name
country_code
country_name
gdp_per_capita
running_total

7. Find the country with the highest average gdp_per_capita for each continent for all years. Now compare your list to the following data set. Please describe any and all mistakes that you can find with the data set below. Include any code that you use to help detect these mistakes.

rank	continent_name	country_code	country_name	avg_gdp_per_capita
1	Africa	SYC	Seychelles	$11,348.66
1	Asia	KWT	Kuwait	$43,192.49
1	Europe	MCO	Monaco	$152,936.10
1	North America	BMU	Bermuda	$83,788.48
1	Oceania	AUS	Australia	$47,070.39
1	South America	CHL	Chile	$10,781.71
